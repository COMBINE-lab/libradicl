# libradicl

Libradicl is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library for reading (and eventually writing and manipulating) 
Reduced Alignment Data (RAD) format files.  These files are produced by [salmon](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon)
when preparing data for single-cell quantification with [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry).

Currently, libradicl has primarily been developed in support of alevin-fry, so it has not been fully developed as 
as a general library quite yet.  Eventually, we anticipate there will be a reorganization and a stabalization 
of the API.
